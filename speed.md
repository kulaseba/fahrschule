## Speed

Reaktionsweg = `(Geschwindigkeit / 10) * 3`

Reaction Distance = `(Speed / 10) * 3`

**Examples**:

| Speed  | Reaction Distance |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30 km/h  | 9 m  |
| 50 km/h  | 15 m |
| 60 km/h  | 18 m |
| 100 km/h  | 30 m |

**You are travelling at 50 km/h and have a reaction time of 1 second. What is the reaction distance according to the rule of thumb?**
- (50 / 10) * 3 = **15 m**

**You are travelling at 50 km/h and have a reaction time of 1 second, and brake normally. What is the stopping distance according to the rule of thumb?**
- 25 m `(Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10) BRAKING DISTANCE`
- 15 m `(Speed / 10) * 3 REACTION DISTANCE`
- 25 + 15 = **40 m**

**What is the maximum speed a truck with a permissible total mass of 3.0 t and trailer may be driven on autobahns?**
- 80 km/h

**What is the maximum speed you are allowed to drive a truck with a permissable total mass of 3.0 t on roads with one marked lane for each direction outside built-up areas?**
- 100 km/h

**You drive around a bend once at 30 km/h and again at 60 km/h. How dows the centrifugal force change?**
- ~~is twice as high~~
- is four times as high
- ~~is the same~~

**On what roads does the recommended speed of 130 km/h apply?**
- Motorways
- On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with separate carriageways for each direction
- On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with at least two marked lanes for each direction

**What increases the danger of "flying out" of a bend when driving at high speed?**
- Accelerating
- Braking
- ~~Disengaging the clutch~~

**How can you drive fuel-efficiently when traveling at a constant speed?**
- By driving at a low engine speed
- By using cruise control
- ~~By driving at a high engine speed~~

**When leaving a built-up area, both you and the vehicle approximately 15 m ahead of you increase speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How should you change the safety distance between you and the vehicle ahead?**
- The safety distance should
  - increase to at least 50 m
  - ~~remain the same~~
  - ~~increase to at least 25 m~~
  
**You are driving at 80 km/h behind a motor vehicle. What is the minimum safe distance you must observe?**
- ~~A distance of 15 meters~~
- ~~A "distance of 1 second"~~
- A "distance of 2 seconds"

**You are driving at 100 km/h on a road not inside a built-up area. In front of you a trick is travelling at 70 km/h. What is the minimum distance you must be from a crest in the road when commencing an overtaking manoeuvre?**
- ~~200 m~~
- 800 m
- ~~400 m~~

**What is the recommended speed that applies to cars and motorcycles on autobahns?**
- 130 km/h

**Where does driving fast often lead to accidents?**
- On bends
- At pedestrian crossings
- At crossroads and junctions

**What is the maximum speed you are allowed to drive a car on roads with one marked lane for each direction outside built-up areas?**
- 100 km/h

**You are travelling at 100 km/h and have a reaction time of 1 second. What is the reaction distance according to the rule of thumb?**
- (100 / 10) * 3 = **30 m**

**You are driving in fog on the autobahn and have 50 m visibility. What is the maximum speed you may drive?**
- ~~70 km/h~~
- ~~90 km/h~~
- 50 km/h

**What is especially important when choosing the speed for driving along tree-lined avenues with narrow roadways?**
- It may be necessary to stop within half the visible distance when a wide vehicle is coming from the opposite direction
- ~~Rapidly changing light conditions make it easier to estimate lateral distances~~
- To estimate the lateral distance to the trees and oncoming traffic simultaneously
