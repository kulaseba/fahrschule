## Speed

Reaktionsweg = `(Geschwindigkeit / 10) * 3`

Reaction Distance = `(Speed / 10) * 3`

**Examples**:

| Speed  | Reaction Distance |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30 km/h  | 9 m  |
| 50 km/h  | 15 m |
| 60 km/h  | 18 m |
| 100 km/h  | 30 m |

**You are travelling at 50 km/h and have a reaction time of 1 second. What is the reaction distance according to the rule of thumb?**
- (50 / 10) * 3 = **15 m**

**You are travelling at 50 km/h and have a reaction time of 1 second, and brake normally. What is the stopping distance according to the rule of thumb?**

25 m `(Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10) BRAKING DISTANCE`
15 m `(Speed / 10) * 3 REACTION DISTANCE`
- 25 + 15 = **40 m**

**What is the maximum speed a truck with a permissible total mass of 3.0 t and trailer may be driven on autobahns?**
- 80 km/h

**What is the maximum speed you are allowed to drive a truck with a permissable total mass of 3.0 t on roads with one marked lane for each direction outside built-up areas?**
- 100 km/h

**You drive around a bend once at 30 km/h and again at 60 km/h. How dows the centrifugal force change?**
- ~~is twice as high~~
- is four times as high
- ~~is the same~~

**On what roads does the recommended speed of 130 km/h apply?**
- Motorways
- On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with separate carriageways for each direction
- On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with at least two marked lanes for each direction

**What increases the danger of "flying out" of a bend when driving at high speed?**
- Accelerating
- Braking
- ~~Disengaging the clutch~~

**How can you drive fuel-efficiently when traveling at a constant speed?**
- By driving at a low engine speed
- By using cruise control
- ~~By driving at a high engine speed~~
