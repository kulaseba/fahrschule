- Entry into the Central Register of Road Traffice Offenders
- ~~An order to resit a theoretical driving licence test~~
- An order to attend an advanced seminar for new drivers

## Safety

**Why is it dangerous not to wear safety belts?**
- Because you cannot adequately protect yourself in case of an impact at a speed of about 20 km/h
- Because in case of an accident, you can be projected out of the vehicle
- ~~Because of the low speed, there is no danger in urban traffic~~

**Your vehicle has no headrests on the rear seats. What can happen if your passengers sit there?**
- ~~Risk of injury is not increased~~
- In the event of a rear-end collision, the risk of injury to such passengers increases

**What must you observe if you wish to drive a vehicle with front passenger air bag?**
- ~~You may install a child restraint on the front passenger seat facing backwards~~
- You may install a child restraint on the front passenger seat facing forwards
- You may not install a child restraint on the front passenger seat facing backwards

**When is it NOT necessary to wear safety belts?**
- ~~Outside build-up areas in a vehicle with airbag~~
- ~~When driving in zones with 30 km/h speed limit~~
- When driving at walking speed

**At which impact speed must you reckon with serious or deadly injuries when no safety belt is worn?**
- ~~From 80 km/h onward~~
- ~~From 50 km/h onward~~
- From 30 km/h onward

**How do you pass through an incline safely?**
- I take my foot off the accelerator completely and
  - ~~switch the ignition off~~
  - ~~drive in neutral~~
  - select a gear in which I am not required to brake a great deal

## Skidding

**What can cause skidding on bends?**
- ~~Load is too small~~
- Faulty shock-absorbers
- Insufficient or uneven tire pressure

## Slopes/Downhill

**Why should you not apply the clutch when driving on a long, steep downhill slope?**
- Because this causes unnecessary wear of the brakes
- Because the braking action of the engine will have no effect

**Why should you not press the clutch and switch off the engine at the same time when driving down a long slope?**
- ~~The battery will be overcharged~~
- Full braking power cannot be reached in vehicles with brake booster system despite great force being applied to the pedal
- The steering of vehicles with servo-assisted steering immediately becomes unusually heavy

## Steering

> Servo-steering = Power Steering

**What does a front-wheel drive car tend to do if you accelerate too much on a bend?**
- ~~The vehicle tends to oversteer~~
- The front end tends to turn out to the side
- ~~The rear end tends to turn out to the side~~

**When can strong side wind be particularly dangerous?**
- When driving past firebreaks in forests
- When driving across bridges
- When overtaking trucks

## Stopping

> **3 min**: Max. time allowed to stop at bus stop provided there is no obstruction to busses.

**Where is it forbidden to stop?**
- On lanes marked with direction arrows
- ~~In front of entrances to and exits from property lots~~
- On merging and demerging lanes

**Where is stopping prohibited?**
- On level crossings
- ~~Immediately behind pedestrian crossings~~
- On narrow sections of the road and at blind spots

## Theft

**How must you safeguard your vehicle against theft?**
- By locking the doors and boot
- ~~By activating the [differential lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locking_differential)~~
- By removing the ignition key, engaging the steering wheel lock, and closing the windows

## Trees

**What are the special conditions when driving along tree-lined avenues?**
- ~~The trees provide protection from the sides~~
- The narrow and often cambered roadway requires special caution when there is oncoming traffic
- There are particularly narrow and blind bends

**What is especially important when choosing the speed for driving along tree-lined avenues with narrow roadways?**
- It may be necessary to stop within half the visible distance when a wide vehicle is coming from the opposite direction
- ~~Rapidly changing light conditions make it easier to estimate lateral distances~~
- To estimate the lateral distance to the trees and oncoming traffic simultaneously

## Vehicle

**How can you tell when you must present your vehicle for the next official inspection (Hauptuntersuchung)?**
- ~~By the kilometer reading~~
- By the entry in the vehicle registration certificate (Fahrzeugschein)
- By the test stamp

**The diesel engine of your vehicle has stopped despite a full fuel tank. What can be the reason?**
- ~~Faulty glow plugs~~

## Visibility

**How can you achieve sufficient visability through the windscreen?**

- I reduce my speed before the bend

## Youth
