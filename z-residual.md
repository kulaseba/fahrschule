- ~~No, because only physical and mental characteristics are decisive~~
- Yes, because this creates doubts about his character

### Modifications

**A technical modification to your vehicle means that the operating license is extinguished. What consequences should you anticipate if you nevertheless use the vehicle on public roads?**
- An entry into the Central Register of Road Traffic Offenders
- A public authority fine
- The loss of my insurance coverage

### Noise Pollution

**How can you reduce the noise made by a car?**
- By driving at a low engine speed
- ~~By using all-terrain tires~~
- ~~By removing the air filter~~

### Pedestrians

**A pedestrian with a white stick wants to cross the road in front of you. What should you do?**
- I have to:
  - reduce speed and stop if necessary
  - ~~continue driving at the same speed~~
  - ~~give a warning signal~~

### Pollution

**What is important to avoid pollution and to save energy when driving?**
- ~~Was the engine regularly, at least four times a year~~
- Have the engine tuning checked regularly
- Check the fuel consumption regularly

**By which percentage does the fuel consumption (l/100 km) of a middle-class car driving at 160 km/h in general increase compared to driving at the recommended speed of 130 km/h?**
- ~~By up to 5%~~
- ~~By up to 10%~~
- By up to 35%

### Safety

**Why is it dangerous not to wear safety belts?**
- Because you cannot adequately protect yourself in case of an impact at a speed of about 20 km/h
- Because in case of an accident, you can be projected out of the vehicle
- ~~Because of the low speed, there is no danger in urban traffic~~

**Your vehicle has no headrests on the rear seats. What can happen if your passengers sit there?**
- ~~Risk of injury is not increased~~
- In the event of a rear-end collision, the risk of injury to such passengers increases

### Skidding

**What can cause skidding on bends?**
- ~~Load is too small~~
- Faulty shock-absorbers
- Insufficient or uneven tire pressure

### Slopes/Downhill

**Why should you not apply the clutch when driving on a long, steep downhill slope?**
- Because this causes unnecessary wear of the brakes
- Because the braking action of the engine will have no effect

### Theft

**How must you safeguard your vehicle against theft?**
- By locking the doors and boot
- ~~By activating the [differential lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locking_differential)~~
- By removing the ignition key, engaging the steering wheel lock, and closing the windows

### Trees

**What are the special conditions when driving along tree-lined avenues?**
- ~~The trees provide protection from the sides~~
- The narrow and often cambered roadway requires special caution when there is oncoming traffic
- There are particularly narrow and blind bends

**What is especially important when choosing the speed for driving along tree-lined avenues with narrow roadways?**
- It may be necessary to stop within half the visible distance when a wide vehicle is coming from the opposite direction
- ~~Rapidly changing light conditions make it easier to estimate lateral distances~~
- To estimate the lateral distance to the trees and oncoming traffic simultaneously

### Wet Surfaces

**What can cause aquaplaning on wet road surfaces?**
- Worn tires
- High speed
- Grooves in the roadway

**You are driving in the wet in a car with trailer on a narrow rural road and are approaching a clearly visible but tight left-hand bend. What should you do?**
- ~~I only brake once I have reached the apex of the bend~~
- I remain in the center of the lane and only accelerate again once I am back on the straight
- I reduce my speed before the bend
