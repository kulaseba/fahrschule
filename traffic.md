**Why does environment friendly driving in general have a beneficial effect on traffic safety?**

- Misjudgments of distances and oncoming traffic frequently result in serious accidents
- Vehicles with high superstructures frequently move to avoid branches
- Even cyclists frequently cannot be overtaken when there is oncoming traffic due to the narrow width of the roadway
