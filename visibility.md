## Visibility

**How can you achieve sufficient visability through the windscreen?**
- When there is slush, switch on the windscreen wipers already before slush is thrown onto your windscreen by other vehicles
- ~~When the windscreen is steamed up, switch the ventilator off and keep the windows closed~~
- Switch on the windscreen wipers from time to time when it is foggy
