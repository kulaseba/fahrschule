## Braking

Bremsweb = `(Geschwindigkeit / 10) * (Geschwindigkeit / 10)`

Braking Distance = `(Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10)`

**Examples**:

| Speed  | Braking Distance |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30 km/h  | 9m  |
| 50 km/h  | 25m |
| 60 km/h  | 36m |
| 100 km/h  | 100m |

*Question*
> You increase your speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How is the braking distance changed according to the rule of thumb?

*Answer*
> It is quadrupled from 25m to 100m `(100 / 10) * (100 / 10) = **100m**`
