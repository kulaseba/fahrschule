## Braking

Bremsweb = `(Geschwindigkeit / 10) * (Geschwindigkeit / 10)`

Braking Distance = `(Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10)`

**Examples**:

| Speed  | Braking Distance |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30 km/h  | 9 m  |
| 50 km/h  | 25 m |
| 60 km/h  | 36 m |
| 100 km/h  | 100 m |

*Question*
> You increase your speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How is the braking distance changed according to the rule of thumb?

*Answer*
> It is quadrupled from 25 m to 100 m `(100 / 10) * (100 / 10) = 100 m`

**What is the effect of an automatic anti-locking device (ABS)?**
- The vehicle is braked in the best possible way also on wet roadways
- ~~Aquaplaning is prevented~~
- Steering control is largely retained when braking

**When braking, you note that your vehicle pulls to the right. What should you do?**
- ~~I do not need to fix the problem, as long as I can compensate by counter-steering~~
- I go to a car workshop
- ~~I oil the brake pads~~
