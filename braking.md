## Braking

**Standard Braking Distance `(Geschwindigkeit / 10) * (Geschwindigkeit / 10)`**
- [`(Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10)`](http://app.fahrschulcard.de/book/b-buch/08/navpoint3)

**Evasive (Emergency) Braking Distance `((Geschwindigkeit / 10) * (Geschwindigkeit / 10)) / 2`**
- [`((Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10)) / 2`](http://app.fahrschulcard.de/book/b-buch/08/navpoint3)

**Examples**:

*Standard*

| Speed  | Braking Distance |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30 km/h  | 9 m  |
| 50 km/h  | 25 m |
| 60 km/h  | 36 m |
| 100 km/h  | 100 m |

*Evasive*

| Speed  | Braking Distance |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30 km/h  | 4.5 m  |
| 50 km/h  | 12.5 m |
| 60 km/h  | 18 m |
| 100 km/h  | 50 m |

**You increase your speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How is the STANDARD braking distance changed according to the rule of thumb?**
- It is quadrupled from 25 m to 100 m `(100 / 10) * (100 / 10) = 100 m`

**What is the rule of thumb when calculating the braking distance for evasive braking on a dry, even and asphalted roadway?**
- ~~((Speed / 10) x 3) / 2~~
- ~~((Speed / 10) x 5) / 2~~
- ((Speed / 10) * (Speed / 10)) / 2

**What is the effect of an automatic anti-locking device (ABS)?**
- The vehicle is braked in the best possible way also on wet roadways
- ~~Aquaplaning is prevented~~
- Steering control is largely retained when braking

**When braking, you note that your vehicle pulls to the right. What should you do?**
- ~~I do not need to fix the problem, as long as I can compensate by counter-steering~~
- I go to a car workshop
- ~~I oil the brake pads~~

**What are the advantages of an [anti-slip device (ASR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_control_system)?**
- ~~No locking of the wheels when braking~~
- No wheelspin when setting off
- Reduced danger of sliding sideways when setting off on a slippery roadway

**The brake lights do not function. What can be the causes of this?**
- Defective stop light switch
- ~~Brake pedal travel too short~~
- Defective bulbs

**In which cases is it imperative to test the brakes?**
- ~~Each time the engine oil is changed~~
- When you drive a different vehicle
- If a vehicle has not been used for a longer period
