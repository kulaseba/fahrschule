## Lighting

### Fog Light
> Fog lights can only be switched on when the visibility is significantly impeded (rain, snow, fog).

> The rear fog light can only be switched on when the visibility due to fog is less than 50 m.
You can see that the rear fog light is switched on by the yellow/amber control light.

**When are you allowed to use fog headlamps also during the day?**
- When the visibility is considerably reduced:
  - by rain
  - by fog or falling snow
  
**How can you tell whether the rear fog lamp is switched on?**
- ~~By the blue indicator light~~
- ~~By the red indicator light~~
- By the amber indicator light

### Parking Light (or "Limiting Light")
> must be used when the vehicle is parked outside closed places.

> is the one-sided lighting of the car and may only be used within closed localities.

### Residual

**You are driving with main beam lights on in darkness. When do you have to dip your headlights?**
- ~~If there are pedestrians moving in the same direction in front of me~~
- If I am driving on a road with constant, adequate lighting
- If I am required to wait at a rail crossing and dazzling others

**The control light of your indicator is blinking considerably faster than usual. What can be the cause of this?**
- ~~The direction indicator switch is defective~~
- A bulb is defective
