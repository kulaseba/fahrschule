## Lighting

### Fog Light
> Fog lights can only be switched on when the visibility is significantly impeded (rain, snow, fog).

> The rear fog light can only be switched on when the visibility due to fog is less than 50 m.
You can see that the rear fog light is switched on by the yellow control light.

**When are you allowed to use fog headlamps also during the day?**
When the visibility is considerably reduced:
- by rain
- by fog or falling snow

### Parking Light (or "Limiting Light")
> must be used when the vehicle is parked outside closed places.

> is the one-sided lighting of the car and may only be used within closed localities.
