## Tires

**What must you remember, particularly when driving with winter tires (M + S)?**
- ~~The maximum permissable speed for cars fitted with snow chains applies~~
- The maximum permissable speed for these tires may not be exceeded
- ~~You may not drive faster than 80 km/h~~

**What must you remember when fitting winter tires (M + S)?**
- Driving characteristics can be different on dry roadways
- ~~The air pressure should be lower than with summer tires~~
- The air pressure should be slightly higher than with summer tires (approx. 0.2 bar)

**What must you remember with regard to tire pressure?**
- To increase the pressure to the level stated in the vehicle manual when the vehicle is heavily loaded
- To check the air pressure regularly, including that of the spare wheel
- ~~To reduce the air pressure before longer trips~~

**What can extend tire life?**
- Avoiding high speeds
- Observing the tire pressure indicated in the owner's manual

**What do you have to check the tires on your vehicle at regular intervals for?**
- For correct air pressure
- For sufficient profile
- For external damage

**1.6 mm**: Minimum profile depth of a tire throughout its circumference.

**What is caused by driving with winter tires during the summer months?**
- It increases:
  - ~~driving stability~~
  - the fuel consumption
  - tire wear
  
**What can be the reason for a tire on front axle wearing on one side more than the other?**
- Steering axle is bent
- Track alignment not in order

**What can you check on your tire?**
- Profile
- Uniform wear of the profile
- The age of the tire

**Tire wear is a burden to the environment. What can extend tire life?**
- ~~Using winter tires (M + S) in the summer~~
- Observing the tire pressure indicated in the owner's manual
- Avoiding high speeds

**One of your tires bursts while you are traveling at high speed on an autobahn. What do you do?**
- Throttle down, if necessary, steer against and brake cautiously
- Stop, if possible, on the hard shoulder, switch on hazard warning lights and place the warning triangle
- ~~Immediately apply the brakes fully and move over onto the hard shoulder~~

**What can be the reason for a tire on the front axle wearing on one side more than the other?**
- Track alignment is not in order
- Steering axle is bent
