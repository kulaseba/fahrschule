## Stopping and Parking

> There must be at least 3m distance between the vehicle parked and the lane divider.

> Before and behind railroad crossings:
- Within the village / 5m 
- Outside the village / 50 m 
- If the crossing marker (St. Andrews Cross) would be covered by the vehicle, it may be up to 10m in front of it not be parked.

> Up to 15m in front of and behind the traffic sign "stop"
- boundary markers can expand this area (the white cars may not park there).
