### Load

> **2.5 m**: Max. height a load is allowed to project above of the vehicle. In other words, the load may not exceed a height of 2.5 m above the vehicle

> **2.5 m**: Max. height for a load to project up to **50 cm** in front of the vehicle

**Up to what height is a load not allowed to project over the front of the vehicle?**
**2.50 m**

**What can be the effect of an overload of only 20%?**
- The brakes may be overstrained
- Steering may become worse
- There may be too much strain on the load-bearing parts of the vehicle

**You want to transport holiday luggage on the roof of your fully loaded car. What is the roof load limited by?**
- The permissable total mass of the car
- ~~The roof load indicated in the vehicle registration certificate (Fahrzeugschein)~~
